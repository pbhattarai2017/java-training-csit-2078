Mary had a little lamb
His fleece was white as snow, yeah
And everywhere the child went
That little lamb was sure to go, yeah
He followed her to school one day
And broke the teacher's rule
But what a time did they have
That day at school
Tisket! Tasket! Baby
A green and yellow basket
Sent a letter to my baby
And on my way I passed it
