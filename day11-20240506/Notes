1. Write a program to test whether the given number is prime or not.
    Get a number from user
    
    Print "Prime"       if the number is so
    Print "Not Prime"   otherwise
    
Divide the number N by every number between i  (1, N).
    If none of the numbers i divide N, then N is prime.
    
2. Generate a list of primes less than N 
    Example: N = 10
    2
    3
    5
    7

3. Create a method "isPrime(N)" that returns boolean accordingly.

4. Write a program to generate a list of random numbers
    Any size, any cycle.
